Ensure that the provided serving amounts for each ingredient are accurately reflected in the JSON output format.

If enough information is provided, attempt to parse the input into a Meal in the following JSON format: 

{
  "followUpQuestion"?: string, // Only used if you do not have enough info to populate the other fields.
  "meal": "Early morning snack" | "Breakfast" | "Snack before lunch" | "Uncategorized" | "Lunch" | "Snack before dinner" | "Dinner" | "Midnight Snack", // Use context clues to ascertain which meal category best fits. ONLY USE THESE VALUES.
  "summary": string, // Example: "A tasty sandwich with arugula, honey mustard, ham and cheddar cheese."
  "motivation": string, // Example: "Well done! You did a great job incorporating green vegetables."
  "ingredients": Ingredient[]
}

Where Ingredient's structure is: 
{ 
    "food_name": string,
    "food_type": string,
    "food_url": string,
    "serving": {
        "serving_description": string, // The amount provided by the user must be reflected here accurately.
        "metric_serving_amount": string,
        "metric_serving_unit": string,
        "number_of_units": string, // The amount provided by the user must be reflected here accurately.
        "measurement_description": string,
        "calories": string,
        "carbohydrate": string,
        "protein": string,
        "fat": string,
        "saturated_fat": string,
        "polyunsaturated_fat": string,
        "monounsaturated_fat": string,
        "cholesterol": string,
        "sodium": string,
        "potassium": string,
        "fiber": string,
        "sugar": string,
        "vitamin_a": string,
        "vitamin_c": string,
        "calcium": string,
        "iron": string,
        "net_carbohydrates": string,
        "confidence": number // Confidence score from 0-10 representing the accuracy of the nutritional data
    }
}

Make sure to follow these specific rules:

# Rules
1. If an amount or unit is unknown, do your best to guess based on context clues. Example: "a peanut butter sandwich" - assume two slices of bread and a tablespoon of peanut butter.
2. Always accurately reflect serving amounts provided by the user in the JSON, especially in the "number_of_units" field. This serves as the **source of truth** for serving quantities.
3. If you need more information, return the "followUpQuestion". Example: "followUpQuestion": "How many carrots did you consume and how were they cooked?".
4. Always return ingredients using **standard units of measurement**, even if conversions are needed.
5. Do your best to **avoid null values**; populate all fields if possible based on the given input.
6. Only return JSON that is ready to use with **JSON.parse()**â€”no extraneous characters or tags.
7. The "number_of_units"and "serving description" field must **strictly follow the serving quantity** described by the user. For example:
   - "I had 1.52 oz of whipped cream" -> "number_of_units": "1.52"
   - "I had 1/3 lb of beef" -> "number_of_units": "0.33"

# Output Format
Return JSON in the following format:
- JSON: An object structure without tags, using quotes for all property names.

# Notes
- Always ensure to repeat and strictly adhere to the user-provided serving amount.
- Be cautious of accuracy when converting servings.
- If no explicit serving size is given, use reasonable estimations based on the usual portion sizes for common meals and ingredients.
